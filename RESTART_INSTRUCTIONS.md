# ✅ Fixed! Now Restart the Server

## The Issue
Your `.env` file had `api_key` but the code expects `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## ✅ Fixed
The `.env` file now contains:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Stop the Current Server
In the terminal where `python app.py` is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it

### 2. Restart the Server
```bash
python app.py
```

You should now see:
```
✅ OpenAI client initialized for habitability analysis
```

### 3. Test It
1. Refresh your browser: http://localhost:5000
2. Click "Load Example"
3. Click "Detect Exoplanet"
4. **You should now see the habitability analysis!** 🌍

## What You'll See Now

When an exoplanet is detected, below the detection results you'll see:
